# Project title : NLP for music lyrics analysis.

# 1. Description of project

- Through this project we aim to build and train models to classify songs into respective genres through their lyrics. We performed similarity analysis of songs of various genres over different periods. We also looked at how accurate models can be when they are trained on lyrics data and how the models perform when we throw different kinds of data at them. We also gained insight on what goes on inside a model and how obvious things about a dataset donâ€™t actually play a significant role in the prediction process. We also performed sentiment analysis on these genres to gauge which genres had the most positive songs and what happens to existing sentiment analysis tools when we input non english data.

While some Python modules are already installed by default,some are not. 
For this reason, requirements.txt file was created to install the remaining modules. 
Missing modules must be installed before running all code.


```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

***requirements.txt*** is found [here](https://github.com/srikacharla/NLPSRI_ARMEL/blob/main/requirements.txt). 

# 4. How to build project

** Note: Make sure all working directories are in root folder.


## 5.1
Data scraping

Song lyrics were extracted using Lyrics genius database. The algorithm for extraction can be found in file (https://github.com/srikacharla/NLPSRI_ARMEL/blob/main/DateDataRetrieval.py). Note that the files: List_of_artists.csv is required to retrieve that data. It contains the list of artists used to extract lyrics from the Genius Database. It can be found [here](https://github.com/srikacharla/NLPSRI_ARMEL/tree/main/Datasets)
To download only lyrics data, run this file(https://github.com/srikacharla/NLPSRI_ARMEL/blob/main/LyricsDataRetieval.py) 

To download lyrics data with date information, run this file (https://github.com/srikacharla/NLPSRI_ARMEL/blob/main/DateDataRetrieval.py) 

To download Bollywood songs, run this file (https://github.com/srikacharla/NLPSRI_ARMEL/blob/main/BollywoodSongsRetrieval.py) 

To translate the Bollywood lyrics and save this data, run this file (https://github.com/srikacharla/NLPSRI_ARMEL/blob/main/BollywoodSongsTranslate.py) 

*** Note: In order to process through the project without extracting the data from Database (which is time-consuming) every time, all extracted data necessary for the project has been stored and can be found in [here](https://github.com/srikacharla/NLPSRI_ARMEL/tree/main/Datasets). 

** Important note** 
In order to run any other files, you first need to have the data in the Datasets folder.

## 5.2 
Similarity within same music genre

Run file: sim_within.py, found here (https://github.com/srikacharla/NLPSRI_ARMEL/blob/main/sim_within.py)  

Output is similarity matrices between song lyrics of the same music genres. See final report Fig. 6 for expected outcome & detailed explanation. 

## 5.3 
Similarity between different genre of music

Run file: sim_between.py, found here (https://github.com/srikacharla/NLPSRI_ARMEL/blob/main/sim_between.py)
